# 8-Queen-Problem-Using-Prolog
The eight queens problem is the problem of placing eight queens on an 8Ã—8 board such that none of the Queen attacks  another (no two are in the same row, column, or diagonal). There are 92 solutions to the 8 x 8 problem. Many of these are reflections and rotations of some of the others, and if we de-duplicate against this, purists state that there are only 12 distinct solutions (92 does not divide equally by 12 because many of the reflections and rotations of a pure solutions are not unique).
